        <p>Out of all my Gadot projects that I've made, by far I had the most fun making my Brick Breaker Game. The
            reason that this was my favorite was because this was the first game that had a theme to it. I made the
            Brick Breaker game have a Dragon Ball theme. It took the longest to do, but the end result was worth all of
            it. This was my favorite project to do on Gadot!</p>

        <p>My favorite Website that I made was the company website. The website was Undertale themed.
            I am a fan of analysis type videos and the website reminds me of those videos.
            This was my favorite because I was able to make a website out of something that I enjoy.
            This made the coding process much more fun and enjoyable. Overall, all of the websites I've done were very
            fun to do.</p>

        <p>While the games and websites had time and effort put into it, the Python challenges were quick and easy for
            me to comprehend.
            Since I did many Python challenges, it's hard to determine which one is my favorite.
            Many of the challenges were a review of Game Development which made it easy for me to get through.
            I haven't completed all of Python Challenges, but so far, I've known many of the concepts.
